STAR FOX EX Manual

Star Fox EX (Exploration Showcase)

Starfox Exploration Showcase began as a simple set of mods for the game meant to
demonstrate what was possible with the full source code and some clever coding.
It has evolved from a personal project to a complete DLC/Addon for the original
Starfox game, including new courses/backgrounds/music/models/modes/secrets.

The plot, characters, models, features and implementations should be enjoyed as unpolished amateur work.

After passing version 9.16, Star Fox Exploration Showcase has been rebranded as

	STARFOX EX

It is recommended that you go through this manual before playing the mod!
